### A simple HTML template for editable, markup-enabled tooltips that appear when you hover over a hotspot of an image map

This template uses jQuery and jQuery UI.

Just paste in your img and map code in the body.

There are several free online image map makers, such as [this](http://www.maschek.hu/imagemap/imgmap) and [this](https://developer.cdn.mozilla.net/media/uploads/demos/s/u/summerstyle/365ccfd644f2b008c33f0046d2ba1a8f/summer-html-image-ma_1355318513_demo_package/index.html).

Make sure the `map` has `id="Map"` and the img has the attribute `usemap="#Map"`.

The text for the tooltip should be in the `alt` attribute of each map `area`.

You can add HTML markup to the tooltip text and create CSS styles of your own.
